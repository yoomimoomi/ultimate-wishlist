# WishTree

WishTree Overview: 
    WishTree is a comprehensive list of all the items one wants to buy. It allows users to input an image, title, description, price, link, and tag(s) for an item or as we call it, an entry. The website assists users by sorting the items into various categories, culminating a total for all items listed, and searching for specific items based on given titles. It limits the need to frantically search for items across different shopping sites. With features that include creating, reading, updating, and deleting entries, the website can ease user experiences with an all in one compact list.
